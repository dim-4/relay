    async def emit(cls, event:Event):
        """
        Asynchronously emits a given event to all compatible listeners 
        registered with the `Bindings` class.

        This method propagates the provided event to all the listener methods 
        which are registered for the event's `channel` and `event_type`.
        However, if some listeners expect events from a particular source,
        the event source will be checked before delivering to them. 

        Listeners will receive the event asynchronously, and any exceptions 
        raised by the listeners are caught and logged, ensuring that one 
        listener's exception will not halt the distribution of the event to 
        other listeners.

        IMPORTANT:
        ---------
        You should `await` this method to ensure that the 
        asynchronous tasks it spawns (for notifying listeners) are scheduled 
        properly.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        - `event (Event[Any])`: The event instance containing the data to be 
        emitted. This should include information like `channel`, `event_type`, 
        and the source of the event optionally.

        Usage:
        -----
        ```python
        # Example to emit an event
        event = Event(data="Hello, World!", 
                      channel="greetings", 
                      event_type="hello")
        await Relay.emit(event)
        ```

        Note:
        ----
        - It's essential that the `Bindings` class has been populated with the 
        necessary listeners for the event to be effectively delivered.
        - If listeners have source restrictions specified, it's crucial that the 
        `event` parameter contains accurate source information.
        - For best practices, always `await` this method, even though not doing 
        so might work in some scenarios.

        Returns:
        -------
        None. However, side effects include calling all the compatible listener 
        methods with the provided event.

        """
        A class method decorator that allows methods within a `Relay` or its 
        child class to emit events with data validation against the provided 
        type hints. It ensures that methods are asynchronous and their return 
        type matches the expected event's payload type.

        This decorator performs two types of checks:
        1. **Static Checks** - Checks that:
            - a. The decorated method is asynchronous.
            - b. The method has a return type hint.
        2. **Dynamic Checks** - Checks that:
            - a. The method belongs to a class inheriting from `Relay`.
            - b. The actual returned data matches the type hint.

        If a method returns an instance of `NoEmit`, the event emission is 
        bypassed, and only the data contained within is returned.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        - `func (Callable)`: The method to be decorated.

        Returns:
        -------
        - `Callable`: The wrapped function that includes event emission logic.

        Raises:
        ------
        - `TypeError`: If the method does not meet the criteria specified above.

        Example:
        --------
        ```python
        class CustomRelay(Relay):
            
            @emits
            async def some_method(self, arg1) -> SomeDataType:
                # some logic...
                return some_data  # This data will be emitted as event payload
        ```

        Note:
        ----
        - The decorated method must belong to a class that either is or 
        inherits from `Relay`.
        - For conditional event emission, the method can return an instance 
        of `NoEmit` to skip the emission but still validate the data type.
        - Bindings to this method are found in `Bindings` class.

        """
        Decorator that validates the data of an `Event` parameter passed 
        to the decorated method.

        1. Statically - Makes sure the decorated method has `event:Event[T]`
        or `event:Event` as a parameter.
        2. Dynamically - Validates the data of the received event against
        the type hint in the method signature.

        The `@receives` decorator is intended for methods that have a 
        parameter named 'event', which should be an instance of the 
        `Event` class. This decorator will validate the data contained 
        within the `Event` against the specified type hint.

        The schema or type is inferred from the type hint of the 'event' 
        parameter. For instance, if the method signature is 
        `def method_name(event: Event[SomeModel])` or `Event[int|str]` or 
        `Event[Union[str, int]]`, etc. the data inside `event` will be 
        validated against the respective type hint.

        If the `event` parameter's type hint doesn't include a specific 
        type (e.g., `Event` without `[SomeType]`), the event data won't 
        be validated.

        If the data does not match the expected type or schema, a 
        `TypeError` is raised.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        - `func (Callable)`: The method to be decorated. Must have a 
        parameter named 'event'.

        Returns:
        -------
        - `Callable`: The wrapped function that includes data validation.

        Raises:
        ------
        - `TypeError`: If the 'event' parameter is missing from the method 
        or if the method's type hint for 'event' is not of type `Event`.
        - Other exceptions may be raised if internal validation crashes.

        Example:
        --------
        ```python
        class SomeRelay(Relay):

            @receives
            def some_method(self, event: Event[SomeModel]):

                # NOTE: same as Event[Any] - event.data will not be validated
                # some logic here
        ```

        ----
        - The decorated method must belong to a class that either is or 
        inherits from `Relay`.
        - The decorated method must have an 'event' parameter, and the type hint
